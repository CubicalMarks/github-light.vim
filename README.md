> Don't join the Dark Side!

All other github colorschemes fail to capture the real github theme. This one
comes as close as I could take it.

**Warning**: I used one of my custom libraries to implement it, therefore you
need to install it as well :/ (yes I know it sucks)

## Install

```vim
Plug 'romgrk/lib.kom'
Plug 'romgrk/github-light.vim'
```
